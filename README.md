weatherly is a small weather forecast app I built for fun. The icons I used are from [basmilius weather-icons](https://github.com/basmilius/weather-icons) and [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/), the third party APIs for weather and geocoding are [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) and [OpenCage](https://opencagedata.com/).
